# Lab 02 – Password Security, Hashing, and Cracking

## Objective
This lab focuses on understanding how passwords are stored using cryptographic hashing, how attackers attempt to crack weak credentials, and what defensive controls reduce credential compromise in real environments.

The goal was to connect theory (hashing, entropy, authentication controls) with practical security thinking rather than memorizing definitions.

## Environment (Simulated)
- Windows workstation
- Local PowerShell hashing utilities
- Sample password dataset
- Offline cracking scenarios (modeled)

## Skills Practiced
- Hashing fundamentals and integrity concepts
- Password attack techniques (dictionary, brute force, credential reuse)
- Risk evaluation and mitigation planning
- Authentication control analysis

## Tools Referenced
- SHA256 hashing
- Password entropy estimation
- Common password dictionaries

## Security+ Alignment
- Cryptography and PKI
- Identity and Access Management
- Threats and Vulnerabilities

## Why I Did This Lab
I wanted to better understand what actually happens to passwords after they are stored and why strong password policies and MFA matter beyond policy documents. Seeing how quickly weak passwords can realistically be compromised made the risk much more concrete.
